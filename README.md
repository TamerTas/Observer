Solomon
=================
Solomon is an asynchronous visitor tracking system built for high-traffic websites.
Nginx is used as the reverse-proxy and PostgreSQL is the database of choice.
The app was built using Tornado 3.1 and Python 3.2. Solomon tracks users
by responding to a get request made by client for a 1x1 pixel and it initiates
a websocket connection to track number of online users
